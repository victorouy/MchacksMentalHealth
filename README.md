Project:
Mental Health Alphabet is a web application that allows people to educate themselves about different types of mental health conditions. We made it in a fun interactive way to make people feel comfortable learning about that subject. Mental Health Alphabet provides resources from healthcare professionals for people in need, such as helplines and links to other websites. We also included a quiz that allows people to estimate their mental well-being.

We built Mental Health Alphabet using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python (Flask). We used Figma to get a rough draft of the layout of our webpage and used Procreate to draw images by hand. Throughout the process, we were actively communicating while live coding using Live Share.


How to run web app:
1. Install Flask by entering in command prompt:  pip install flask
2. In project folder 'AlphabetMentalHealth', enter in command prompt:  python "app.py"
3. Enter in web browser the allocated url given
